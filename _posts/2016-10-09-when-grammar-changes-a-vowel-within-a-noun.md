Norwegian nouns have three genders, and the definite form is made in by adding the suffix _-en_ for masculine, _-a_ for feminine and _-et_ for neuter (remember that the _t_ is silent!). These suffixes are unstressed, and the _e_ in _-en_ and _-et_ is pronounced [ə]. It almost sounds like it’s not even there, yet the _-n_ is always pronounced.

Masculine nouns that end with an _-r_ in their indefinite form often go through an alteration of the pronunciation of the last vowel! Monosyllable nouns such as bror and far are pronounced [[bɾuːɾ]](/wp-content/bror.m4a) and [[fɑːɾ]](/wp-content/far.m4a). Notice what happens when they are definite: Broren is pronounced [[bɾuːuɳ]](/wp-content/broren.m4a) and faren is pronounced [[fɑːɑɳ]](/wp-content/faren.m4a). A vowel is doubled with a pause in between. The _e_ of _-en_ disappears completely, and the _r_ and _n_ merge to form a [retroflex]({% link _posts/2013-12-08-the-pronunciation-of-rs-rn-rt-rd-and-rl.md %}) /ɳ/. As a foreigner, it is important to be aware of the distinction between [[fɑːɑɳ]](/wp-content/faren.m4a) (faren) and [[fɑːɑn]](/wp-content/faen.m4a) (faen), as the second word a swear word!

Some speakers of standard Eastern Norwegian turn feminine nouns into masculine nouns. Mor and jord (which are feminine nouns) will thus become [[muːuɳ]](/wp-content/moren.m4a) and [[juːuɳ]](/wp-content/jorden.m4a) (if you pay close attention when you listen to these two words, you will notice that they have different [tonemes]({% link _posts/2014-02-14-tonemes-or-why-norwegians-sound-like-they-are-singing.md %})). If they are kept feminine, the pronunciation is [[muːɾɑ]](/wp-content/mora.m4a) and [[juːɾɑ]](/wp-content/jorda.m4a) (again, different [tonemes]({% link _posts/2014-02-14-tonemes-or-why-norwegians-sound-like-they-are-singing.md %})). Attempting to speak the Oslo dialect and wanting to sound native, yet pronouncing these words \*[muːɾen] or \*[juːɾen] (incorrect in any Norwegian dialect! The closest you get is the Bergen dialect, but they use a guttural R similar to French or German: [[muːʁɛn]](/wp-content/bergensk_moren.m4a)) will give you away as a foreigner.
