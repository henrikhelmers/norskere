My students usually want to sound more like a Norwegian. As we have many different dialects, speaking like a Norwegian can mean different things in different places. Our capital, Oslo, is located in Østlandet, and the dialects in the surrounding area all belong to _østnorsk_ (_øst_ = east). The variation typically taught to foreigners both in Oslo and elsewhere is known as _standard østnorsk_, that is, _bokmål_ (our most common written language) spoken with an _østnorsk_ phonology.

This includes the retroflex sounds, written as rs, rn, rt, rd and rl. In short, you pronounce /rs/ as an s/sh-sound while keeping the tongue where the rolled r is usually pronounced! This sounds similar to the English sh. Retroflex means that the tip of the tongue is curled up and back, to where the r is usually articulated. The r and s thus merge and create a retroflex s-sound, which is transcribed ʂ with IPA (the International Phonetic Alphabet). This always happens between words as well, unless you pause between the words. «_Vær så god_» (_you’re welcome_, literally: _be so good_) is thus pronounced [væʂågo]. «_Han er snill_» (_he is kind_) is pronounced [han æʂnill].

When r and n meet, the same thing happens. Norwegian /n/ is pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching your upper front teeth. When an r and an n meet, the tongue is curled up, and the n is pronounced where you would pronounce the r. In IPA, this sound is represented with the symbol ɳ. The word _barn_ (child, children) is pronounced [baɳ]. The same thing happens between words: «_Har noen kommet?_» (_Has anyone arrived?_) is pronounced «[haɳoen] kommet»?»

Norwegian t is pronounced with the tip of the tongue touching the upper front teeth, but /rt/ is pronounced with the tongue curled up, which can be written with the IPA ʈ. _Bart_ (moustache) is pronounced baʈ. This happens in word boundaries as well, and «_Jeg har to_» (I have two) is pronounced «Jeg [haʈo]»

The same pattern can be seen when it comes to /rd/. _Hvordan_ (how) is pronounced [hvoɖan]. Most of the examples are found between words: «_Er det?_» (Is it?) and «_Hva gjør du?_» (What are you doing?) are pronounced [æɖe] and «hva [gjøɖu]?». Some words are pronounced without this retroflex, keeping the r and d distinct. The word _verden_ (world) can be pronounced ver-den or [veɖen], and the same is true for _sverd_ (sword).
