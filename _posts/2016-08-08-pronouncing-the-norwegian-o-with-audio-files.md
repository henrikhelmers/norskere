The standard pronunciation, and thus the name, of the letter o in Norwegian is different from that of most other languages. In English, the pronunciation of this letter varies, but it is [əʊ] when isolated, whereas in the Romance languages, the pronunciation is usually [o]. In Norwegian, however, the standard pronunciation of the letter o is [uː]. [Listen to it here.](/wp-content/long-u.m4a) Similar to the English `/oo/` in _tool_. It retains this pronunciation ([uː]) in words such as _stor, fot, bok, snok_ and _kvote_. (Listen to [stor](/wp-content/stor.m4a), [fot](/wp-content/fot.m4a) and [kvote](/wp-content/kvote.m4a))

A Norwegian vowel is most often ([short]({% link _posts/2016-07-02-norwegian-vowels-long-or-short.md %})) when in front of a double consonant. The letter o is usually pronounced [[ɔ](/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/short-o.m4a)] when it is short. Examples include _flott, lokk, sokker, hoppe, kort_ and _norsk_. (Listen to [flott](/wp-content/flott.m4a), [lokk](/wp-content/lokk.m4a) and [norsk](/wp-content/norsk.m4a)). There are exceptions to this rule, in which the o is pronounced [u] when short: _fort, morsom_ [‘muʂɔm]. (Listen to [morsom](/wp-content/morsom.m4a))

There are even a few words in which the o is pronounced [[oː](/wp-content/long-o.m4a)]! This long vowel phoneme is usually written with the Norwegian letter å, but in the words _tog, sove, love_ and _hoven_ the o is a long [o:]. (Listen to [tog](/wp-content/tog.m4a) and [sove](/wp-content/sove.m4a))

Listen to these minimal pairs. Although they look similar when written they are pronounced differently.
