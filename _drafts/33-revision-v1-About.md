_The language geek:_  
I have been a language geek since I started talking. I invented my own language in kindergarten, and I found a book about Sami grammar at the attic when I was 8, and started learning all of the verb tenses and noun cases.

Yes.. I was a geek. During our many travels to France (my mother is a French teacher and has many friends in France whom we visited) I picked up quite a lot of French. When I was 12 we traveled to Greece for a couple of weeks, and I received a tiny phrase book, and taught myself both the alphabet and some basic phrases and grammar. Then, in junior high school (_ungdomskolen_) I taught myself the Russian (Cyrillic), Arabic and Hebrew alphabets. When I was 17 I went to the United States for one year as an exchange student. In addition to greatly improving my English just by speaking English 24/7 for year, I bought myself a Teach-yourself-Arabic book and learned some basic Arabic. Upon returning to Norway for my last year of high school (_videreg√•ende_), I continued with the Italian class I had started two years before, and I got the top grade both in Italian and English.

I thereby went on to the University of Oslo where I started studying Spanish and Latin American studies. I did a whole lot more Spanish classes than the obligatory amount, and in addition I took a Portuguese class, an English class and some linguistics. My master thesis was on Spanish and linguistics, and during the first year on my master program I took lots of linguistics classes, before embarking on my thesis. In my thesis I compared the phonologies of Norwegian and Spanish, and looked into how the phonology of Norwegian affected Spaniards&#8217; (and Latin Americans&#8217;) pronunciation of Norwegian. My entire master thesis can be read [here](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/25818?locale-attribute=en).

Needless to say, I find languages and linguistics extremely interesting and fascinating in and by themselves. I realize most people don&#8217;t feel the same way, seeing languages in stead as a useful tool for communicating with people in different countries.

As I am so passionate about languages, I hope to be able to use some of that passion to inspire others, and to help others learn languages and linguistics.
