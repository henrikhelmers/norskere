<p style="text-align: left;">
  Norwegian nouns have three genders, and the definite is usually made in writing by adding the suffix -en for masculine, -a for feminine and -et for neuter (remember that the t is silent!). These suffixes are unstressed, and the e of -en and -et is pronounced as [ə]. It almost sounds like it&#8217;s not even there, yet the -n is always pronounced.

Masculine nouns that end with an -r in their indefinite form often go through an alteration of the pronunciation of the last vowel! Monosyllable nouns such as bror and far are pronounced [[bɾuːɾ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bror.m4a) and [[fɑːɾ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/far.m4a). Notice what happens when they are definite: Broren is pronounced [[bɾuːuɳ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/broren.m4a) and faren is pronounced [[fɑːɑɳ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/faren.m4a). A second vowel is added. There is a small pause in between the first and second vowel. The e of -en disappears completely, and the r and n merge to form a [retroflex](http://norskere.no/?p=8) /ɳ/. As a foreigner, it is important to be aware of the distinction between [[fɑːɑɳ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/faren.m4a) (faren) and [[fɑːɑn]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/faen.m4a) (faen), as the second word is used as a swear word.

Certain speakers of standard Eastern Norwegian turn feminine nouns into masculine nouns. Mor and jord (which are feminine nouns) will thus become [[muːuɳ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/moren.m4a) and [[juːuɳ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/jorden.m4a) (if you pay close attention when you listen to these two words, you will notice that they have different [tonemes](http://norskere.no/?p=27)). If they are kept feminine, the pronunciation is [[muːɾɑ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/mora.m4a) and [[juːɾɑ]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/jorda.m4a) (again, different [tonemes](http://norskere.no/?p=27)). Attempting to speak the Oslo dialect and wanting to sound native, yet pronouncing these words \*[muːɾen] or \*[juːɾen] (incorrect in any Norwegian dialect! The closest you get is the Bergen dialect, but they use a guttural R similar to French or German: [[muːʁɛn]](http://norskere.no/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bergensk_moren.m4a)) will give you away as a foreigner.
